# Adaptive gradient optimization methods 

In the present project I have implemented some adaptive gradient optimization methods, to minimize a 1D function that have a lot of local minimum points. The animation of the minimum search process and the evolution of the cost function are shown.

Adaptive Gradient Optimization (AGO) methods are implemented as black box optimizer in some Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, PyThorch, Keras, etc.

I have used some of these AGO methods to perform the Full Waveform Inversion process, as you can see in my PhD publication:
